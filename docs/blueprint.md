## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich purple (#6750A4) reflecting sophistication and reliability, aligning with the brand's aim for trust. Derived from aspirational feelings, and slightly away from the tech cliche of blues and teals.
- Background color: Light purple (#F2F0FA), a desaturated version of the primary color to maintain visual consistency while providing a subtle, non-intrusive background.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#A395C7), analogous to the primary purple, used to highlight interactive elements and CTAs without overpowering the design.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for headlines and short text, ensuring a contemporary and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif to guarantee excellent readability in body text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent various car features and functionalities, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Logo: The logo should have a blue gradient
- Implement a consistent, grid-based layout to ensure responsiveness and a clean, organized presentation across different screen sizes.
